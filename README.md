# Roommate Roulette

Welcome to **Roommate Roulette!** 

## Overview

Roommate Roulette is an application designed to help you find the perfect roommate(s) for your living situation. Whether you're searching for a single roommate or a group, this tool simplifies the process of finding compatible housemates.

## How To Get Started
1. Register as a new account.
2. After registration, login with your credentials.
3. Create your group (OR if you wish to join an existing group from our seed file, the group usernames can be found in the database, and our group password for all of the groups in our seed file is RandomPassword.)
4. When your group is created, you can invite other people into your group by telling other users the group username and group password that you set up.
5. Now that you and your roommates are in the group, start searching for your future roommates!
6. When you find someone who matches what your group is looking for, you may match with them.
7. If they match with you back, contact info is released between the 2 groups and you are able to message each other onsite.
8. Happy searching!
